What happens when the user completes the transaction on the page?
When the user enter's their payment details, rave would validate then charge the card. Once the charge is completed we would:

Call your redirect url and post the response to you, we also append your reference and our unique reference as query params to the url.

Call your hook url (if one is set).

Send an email to you and your customer on the successful payment. If email to customers is turned off we wouldn't send emails.

Before you give value to the customer, please make a server-side call to our verification endpoint to confirm the status and properties of the transaction.

Step 3: Handling payment response / verifying transaction.
When a transaction is completed we send an event to your hook url and also append the reference to your redirect url you can use either of both responses to verify payment and give value to the customer.

ðŸ“˜
Remember to check

if using .htaccess, remember to add the trailing / to the url you set.
Do a test post to your URL and ensure the script gets the post body.
Only set a publicly available url (http://localhost cannot receive!)
You can pick up the reference or use the post body send to your redirect url to verify transaction and give value. In this example we would use the reference from the url.

webhook.php
redirect-page.php

<?php

// Retrieve the request's body
$body = @file_get_contents("php://input");

// retrieve the signature sent in the reques header's.
$signature = (isset($_SERVER['verif-hash']) ? $_SERVER['verif-hash'] : '');

/* It is a good idea to log all events received. Add code *
 * here to log the signature and body to db or file       */

if (!$signature) {
    // only a post with rave signature header gets our attention
    exit();
}

// Store the same signature on your server as an env variable and check against what was sent in the headers
$local_signature = getenv('SECRET_HASH');

// confirm the event's signature
if( $signature !== $local_signature ){
  // silently forget this ever happened
  exit();
}

http_response_code(200); // PHP 5.4 or greater
// parse event (which is json string) as object
// Give value to your customer but don't give any output
// Remember that this is a call from rave's servers and 
// Your customer is not seeing the response here at all
$response = json_decode($body);
if ($response->body->status == 'successful') {
    # code...
    // TIP: you may still verify the transaction
            // before giving value.
}
exit();
